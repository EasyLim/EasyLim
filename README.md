### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am EasyLim. I like to do and learn something new and interesting. I have no real projects, I am working on interesting nature or physics simulations.

Github wants me to write it (lol):
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on several projects and trying to have more practice
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with OOP patterns

I will glad to connect with someone, so here are my contacts:
